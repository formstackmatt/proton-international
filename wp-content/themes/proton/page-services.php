        <p class="message margin-none">While building proton therapy centers is becoming a necessity for leaders in healthcare, we understand financing and cost are common barriers to accomplishing this goal. That’s why we offer flexible financing options focused on helping your institution build a state-of-the-art treatment center in the more immediate future. Our financing plans include co-investment and off-balance-sheet options that ensure financing does not keep your patients from receiving the best and most effective cancer treatment.</p>
